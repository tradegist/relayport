# IBKR Webhook Relay — Project Guidelines

## Code Quality (MANDATORY)

- **Always apply best practices by default.** Do not ask the user whether to follow a best practice — just do it. Use idiomatic Python naming, file organization, and patterns. When there is a clearly better approach (naming, structure, error handling), use it directly and explain why.
- **No unused imports.** After writing or editing any Python file, verify every `import` is actually used in the file. Remove any that are not. This applies to new files and edits to existing files alike.
- **No `__all__`.** All imports are explicit (`from module import X`). `__all__` only controls star-imports, which we never use.
- **No `assert` for runtime guards.** `assert` is stripped under `python -O`, turning invariant checks into silent `None`/`AttributeError`. Use `if ... raise RuntimeError(...)` (or `die()`) for any check that must hold at runtime.
- **Makefile must mirror CLI arguments.** When adding a new parameter to a `cli/` command, always add the corresponding `$(if $(VAR),--flag $(VAR))` to the Makefile target so `make <target> VAR=value` works.
- **Update README.md when changing public interfaces.** When adding or modifying CLI commands, Makefile targets, API endpoints, or env vars, always update the README to reflect the change.
- **Run `make lint` after every code change.** Ruff enforces unused imports (F401), import ordering (I001), unused variables, common pitfalls (bugbear), and modern Python idioms. If ruff fails, fix before committing. Use `make lint FIX=1` to auto-fix safe issues (import sorting, etc.).
- **Register new modules in `pyproject.toml`.** When adding a new Python service, package, or standalone module under `services/`, immediately add it to all four places in `pyproject.toml`: (1) `tool.pytest.ini_options.testpaths`, (2) `tool.ruff.src`, (3) `tool.ruff.lint.isort.known-first-party`, and (4) the mypy invocation in the Makefile. Missing any of these causes silent miscategorisation (isort), missed tests (pytest), or unchecked code (mypy).

## Security Rules (MANDATORY)

- **No hardcoded credentials** — passwords, API tokens, secrets, and keys MUST come from environment variables (`.env` file or `TF_VAR_*`). Never write real values in source files.
- **No hardcoded IPs** — use `DROPLET_IP` from `.env`. In documentation, use `1.2.3.4` as placeholder.
- **No hardcoded domains** — use `example.com` variants (`vnc.example.com`, `trade.example.com`) in docs and code. Actual domains are loaded at runtime via `VNC_DOMAIN` / `SITE_DOMAIN` env vars.
- **No email addresses or personal info** — never write real names, emails, or account IDs in committed files. Use `UXXXXXXX` for IBKR account examples.
- **No logging of secrets or sensitive operational data** — never `log.info()` or `print()` tokens, passwords, or API keys. Log actions and outcomes, not credential values. When adding any `log.info()` or `log.debug()` call, check whether the logged value contains sensitive fields (e.g. `accountId`, `acctAlias`, account numbers, IPs, domains). Never log full model dumps at `info` level — use `log.debug` with explicit field exclusion: `log.debug("Trade: %s", trade.model_dump_json(exclude={"accountId", "acctAlias"}))`. Prefer logging counts, symbols, and statuses over full objects.
- **`.env`, `*.tfvars`, and `.env.test` are gitignored** — never commit them. Use `.env.example` / `.env.test.example` with placeholder values as reference.
- **Terraform state is gitignored** — `terraform.tfstate` contains SSH keys and IPs. Never commit it.
- **Auth middleware must reject empty `API_TOKEN`.** `hmac.compare_digest("", "")` returns `True`, so an empty `API_TOKEN` env var silently disables authentication. Every auth middleware must check `if not _API_TOKEN:` and return HTTP 500 **before** reaching `compare_digest`. `API_TOKEN` is in `required_env` for deploy/sync — the CLI will block deployment if it is missing or empty.

## Type Safety (MANDATORY)

- **Python >= 3.11 is required.** The project uses `X | None` union syntax natively (no `from __future__ import annotations`). Docker images use `python:3.11-slim`. Local dev uses a `.venv` created from the latest Homebrew Python.
- **Run `make typecheck` before copying ANY Python file to the droplet.** This is non-negotiable. If mypy fails, do NOT push the code.
- **Run `make test` before assuming work is done and before copying ANY file to the droplet.** If tests fail, fix them first. Never deploy untested code.
- **Run `make test` and `make typecheck` after every code change**, even refactors. Do not wait until the end — verify immediately.
- **Run E2E tests after modifying any E2E test OR infrastructure file.** Infrastructure files include `docker-compose*.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `Caddyfile`, `.env.test.example`, and anything under `infra/`. E2E tests require the Docker stack — `make test` (unit tests) does not run them. Never assume an E2E test passes without actually running the stack. The E2E workflow is:
  1. `make e2e-up` — start the stack (idempotent, skips if already running).
  2. `make e2e-run` — run the tests.
  3. Fix code → `make e2e-run` → repeat until all tests pass. Volume mounts keep code in sync — no rebuild needed.
  4. `make e2e-down` — tear down **only after all tests pass**. Never tear down between iterations.
- When modifying any Python file (`.py`), always run `make test`, `make typecheck`, and `make lint` and confirm all pass before deploying.
- **Every Python file must be covered by `make typecheck`.** When adding a new Python service, package, or standalone script, immediately add it to the mypy invocation in the Makefile. No Python file may exist outside mypy's scope.
- After modifying any model in `services/poller/models_poller.py` or `services/remote-client/models_remote_client.py`, also run `make types` to regenerate the TypeScript definitions.
- **Always verify type safety by breaking it first.** After any refactor that touches types or model construction, deliberately introduce a type error (e.g. pass a `str` where `float` is expected), run `make typecheck`, and confirm it **fails**. Then revert and confirm it passes. Never assume mypy catches something — prove it.
- **Avoid `dict[str, Any]` round-trips.** Never use `model_dump()` → `dict` → `Model(**data)` — mypy cannot type-check `**dict[str, Any]`. Use explicit keyword arguments or `model_copy(update=...)` instead.
- **Prefer strict `Literal` types over bare `str` on Pydantic models.** Financial applications demand precision — a `str` field silently accepts typos and invalid values. When a field has a known set of valid values (e.g. `Action`, `OrderType`, `SecType`, `TimeInForce`), always use the existing `Literal` type. Only fall back to `str` when the external source (e.g. IB Gateway) genuinely returns unbounded values — and document why with an inline comment. At the mapping boundary (e.g. `_map_trade`), use `cast()` so mypy is satisfied and Pydantic validates at runtime.
- **No `# type: ignore` without justification.** Do not bypass the type checker. Fix the root cause instead — use proper type annotations, import the correct type, widen a dict annotation, or use `cast()`. If suppression is truly unavoidable (e.g. untyped third-party library), the comment must include a reason: `# type: ignore[attr-defined] # ib_async.Foo has no stubs`. A bare `# type: ignore` with no explanation is never acceptable.
- **Use `@overload` for sentinel-default patterns.** When a function accepts an optional default via a sentinel (e.g. `_UNSET = object()`), use `@overload` to express the two call signatures (`def f(key: str) -> str` and `def f(key: str, default: str) -> str`) instead of `# type: ignore` on the return. Use `cast()` in the implementation body for the default branch.

## Pydantic Best Practices

- **Use `Field(default_factory=list)`** for mutable defaults (`list`, `dict`) **only when the field is genuinely optional.** Never use bare `[]` or `{}` as default values — it risks shared mutable state.
- **Do not add defaults to fields that are always populated.** A default (`= 0`, `= ""`, `= Field(default_factory=list)`) makes the field optional in the generated JSON Schema and TypeScript types (e.g. `fillCount?: number`). If the construction code always provides the value, the field must be required (no default) so the schema reflects the true contract. Only use defaults for fields that are legitimately absent in some cases (e.g. XML attributes that may be missing).
- **Use `ConfigDict(extra="forbid")`** on models that define an external contract (e.g. webhook payloads, API responses). This produces `additionalProperties: false` in the JSON Schema, keeping generated TypeScript types strict (no `[k: string]: unknown`).
- **Docstrings on `parse_fills()` and similar claim "never raises"** — ensure the implementation matches. Wrap any call that can throw (e.g. `ET.fromstring()`) in try/except and return errors in the result tuple.

## Error Handling (MANDATORY)

- **Every error must produce a clear, actionable message.** Whether the consumer is an API caller or a developer reading logs, the error must explain _what_ failed and _why_. Never raise or return a generic "something went wrong" — include the relevant context (operation, input identifier, upstream status code, etc.).
- **API responses must never leak internal details.** Return structured error JSON with an appropriate HTTP status code and a human-readable `error` field. Never expose raw Python tracebacks, file paths, or internal class names to API callers. Log the full exception server-side at `error`/`exception` level for debugging.
- **Isolate failures — one bad component must not take down the system.** When dispatching to multiple backends, plugins, or external services, wrap each call in `try/except Exception`, log the failure, and continue. A single broken notifier, webhook endpoint, or third-party API must not crash the poll cycle, block other notifiers, or kill the HTTP server.
- **Never silently swallow errors.** Every `except` block must either log the exception (`log.exception(...)`) or re-raise. A bare `except: pass` is never acceptable — it hides bugs and makes debugging impossible.
- **Use `log.exception()` for unexpected errors.** It automatically includes the traceback at `ERROR` level. Reserve `log.error()` for known/expected failure conditions where a traceback would be noise.
- **Distinguish recoverable from fatal errors.** Recoverable errors (network timeout, temporary API failure) should be logged and retried or skipped. Fatal errors (missing required config, corrupted state) should fail fast with `raise SystemExit(1)` or `die()` and a clear message — do not attempt to limp along.
- **Validate at system boundaries, trust internally.** Validate all external inputs (API payloads, env vars, webhook data, IB Gateway responses) at the point of entry. Once validated, internal code should not re-validate — the type system and Pydantic models carry the guarantees.
- **Never assume a default for financial enum fields.** When mapping external data to a constrained set (e.g. buy/sell side, order type), validate that the value is an exact match. Never use an `else` branch that silently assigns a default — e.g. `BuySell.BUY if x == "buy" else BuySell.SELL` treats _any_ non-buy value (including typos, nulls, and garbage) as SELL. Always check every valid value explicitly and raise/error on unknown input. This applies to all trade direction, order type, asset class, and similar mappings.
- **Never silently drop rows with missing identifiers.** When parsing external data (Flex XML, REST JSON, WebSocket messages), if a required identifier (e.g. `execId`) is missing or empty after all fallback chains, report it as a parse error and skip the row explicitly. Do not let it fall through to a later guard (like a dedup check on empty string) where the drop is invisible. Every skipped row must produce an error message explaining _why_ it was skipped.
- **HTTP handlers must catch and map exceptions.** Every route handler must have a top-level `try/except` that catches unexpected errors and returns a proper HTTP error response (500 with structured JSON). Unhandled exceptions in aiohttp handlers produce ugly default responses and can leak internals.
- **Include context in error messages.** Bad: `"Failed to place order"`. Good: `"Failed to place order: TSLA BUY 2 LMT @ 150.0 — IB Gateway returned error code 201: 'Order rejected'"`. The message should contain enough detail to diagnose without consulting logs.

## Reliability (MANDATORY)

- **Mark-after-notify, never before.** `mark_processed_batch()` (or `mark_processed()`) must only run AFTER `notify()` completes successfully. A crash between mark and notify silently drops fills — the fill is recorded as processed but the webhook was never sent. Neither the listener (dedup skips it) nor the poller (dedup skips it) will ever retry it. This is an unrecoverable data loss.
- **The correct pattern:** run `notify()` and `mark_processed_batch()` sequentially in the same execution context (same thread or same `asyncio.to_thread` call). If `notify()` raises, the fill remains unprocessed and will be retried on the next cycle.
- **Never separate mark from notify with an `await` boundary.** In async code, an `await` between mark and notify allows the process to crash between the two operations. Keep them atomic within a single synchronous block (e.g. inside `asyncio.to_thread`).
- **Replay mode is the exception.** `poll --replay N` intentionally skips dedup — it resends the last N fills without marking them. This is by design for debugging/recovery.
- **SQLite commits must be explicit.** After any `INSERT`/`UPDATE` to SQLite (dedup DB or metadata DB), call `conn.commit()` immediately. Without an explicit commit, a crash loses the write silently. Never rely on implicit commit behavior.

## Concurrency Safety (MANDATORY)

- **Assume concurrency by default.** Both services are async (aiohttp). Any handler can be interrupted at an `await`. When writing new code, always consider what happens if two requests arrive at the same time.
- **Always be wary of race conditions.** Before merging any code that touches shared state, ask: "Can two callers interleave here? What breaks if they do?"
- **Never use TOCTOU (Time of Check, Time of Use) patterns with locks.** Do NOT check `lock.locked()` and then `async with lock:` — another coroutine can acquire the lock between the check and the acquisition, defeating the guard. This is a race condition.
- **Lock acquisition must BE the check.** Use `asyncio.wait_for(lock.acquire(), timeout=0)` with `try/finally: lock.release()` to fail-fast, or accept that `async with lock:` will queue. Never separate "is it locked?" from "acquire it."
- **This applies to all shared-state guards** — locks, database transactions, file locks, semaphores, balance checks. If the action is "check a condition, then act on it," both steps must be atomic.
- **Never share a `sqlite3.Connection` across threads.** `sqlite3.Connection` is not thread-safe. When using `asyncio.to_thread()`, either pass the connection into a single synchronous function that does all DB work in one thread, or use an `asyncio.Lock` to ensure only one `to_thread()` call uses the connection at a time. Never allow two concurrent `to_thread()` calls to touch the same connection — this causes intermittent `OperationalError` and data corruption.
- **Poller/listener `to_thread` pattern: create connections inside the worker thread.** Do NOT create `sqlite3.Connection` on the main (event-loop) thread and pass it into `asyncio.to_thread(poll_once, conn, ...)` — even with `check_same_thread=False`, this is cross-thread use and unsafe. Instead, `poll_once()` accepts `dedup_conn=None, meta_conn=None` and creates thread-local connections internally (via `init_dedup_db()` / `init_meta_db()`), closing them in a `finally` block. The caller (`_poll_loop`, `handle_run_poll`) passes only non-DB arguments. This ensures every `to_thread` call uses connections that were both created and closed on the same worker thread.
- **Financial operations require extra scrutiny.** Any code path that places orders, moves money, or modifies account state must be reviewed for: race conditions, double-execution, partial failure (what if it crashes between two steps?), and idempotency.
- **Use `asyncio.get_running_loop()`, never `asyncio.get_event_loop()`.** `get_event_loop()` is deprecated since Python 3.10 for contexts without a running loop and emits `DeprecationWarning` in 3.12+. Code that calls `loop.call_later()`, `loop.create_task()`, etc. always runs on the event-loop thread, so `get_running_loop()` is correct, explicit, and raises `RuntimeError` immediately if accidentally called off-loop.

## Local Development

- **`.venv` is the project's virtual environment.** Created by `make setup` using Homebrew Python. All dev dependencies are installed there.
- **Auto-activation** is configured in `~/.zshrc` via a `chpwd` hook — the venv activates automatically when `cd`'ing into the project directory.
- **`make setup`** creates the `.venv` (if missing), installs all dependencies (`requirements-dev.txt` + both service requirements), and writes a `.pth` file (see below).
- **`ibkr-relay.pth`** is created inside `.venv/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/` by `make setup`. It adds `services/poller/`, `services/remote-client/`, and `services/` to `sys.path` so that `from models_poller import ...`, `from models_remote_client import ...`, and `from notifier import ...` work everywhere (CLI, tests, scripts) without `sys.path` hacks or `PYTHONPATH`.
- **`.venv/` is gitignored** — never commit it.

## Dependency Management

- **Runtime deps (`services/poller/requirements.txt`, `services/remote-client/requirements.txt`)** use exact pins (`==`). These are deployed to production containers — builds must be reproducible.
- **Dev deps (`requirements-dev.txt`)** use major-version constraints (`>=X,<X+1`). This allows minor/patch updates while preventing breaking changes.
- **When adding a new dependency**, always pin it immediately — never leave it unpinned. Use exact pin for runtime, major-version constraint for dev.

## Docker

- **Never use `env_file:` in service definitions.** Always declare each env var explicitly in the `environment:` block with `${VAR}` interpolation. This is critical because `env_file:` is internally a list — override files append rather than replace, causing the production `.env` to leak into test containers. Explicit `environment:` vars with `--env-file` interpolation keeps environments fully isolated and allows clean overrides.
- **`POLLER_ENABLED=false`** disables the poller container entirely. Implemented via `deploy.replicas: ${POLLER_REPLICAS:-1}` in `docker-compose.yml`. The mapping from `POLLER_ENABLED` to `POLLER_REPLICAS` happens in `cli/__init__.py` (`_compose_env()`) and the Makefile (`POLLER` flag). The derived `POLLER_REPLICAS` is injected as a shell env var in the SSH command (not in `.env`), so it takes precedence over the compose file default.
- **`REMOTE_CLIENT_ENABLED=false`** disables the entire gateway stack: `ib-gateway`, `novnc`, `remote-client`, and `gateway-controller`. Same mechanism as poller: `deploy.replicas: ${GATEWAY_REPLICAS:-1}` on all four services, mapped from `REMOTE_CLIENT_ENABLED` via `_compose_env()` and the Makefile `REMOTE_CLIENT` flag. Gateway-specific required env vars (`TWS_USERID`, `TWS_PASSWORD`, `VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD`) use `:-` defaults in compose and are validated by the CLI when the gateway is enabled.
- **`.dockerignore` uses an allowlist** (`*` to exclude everything, then `!services/poller/**` to include the whole module). Tests, `__pycache__`, and the Dockerfile itself are re-excluded. This means adding new source files to `services/poller/` requires **no** `.dockerignore` or Dockerfile changes.
- **When adding a new standalone module** (e.g. `services/notifier/`), you must add a `!services/<module>/**` entry to `.dockerignore` — the allowlist excludes everything by default. Also add exclusions for test files and `__pycache__` under the new module. Without this, `COPY services/<module>/ ./<module>/` in the Dockerfile will fail with a cryptic "not found" error.
- The poller Dockerfile uses directory COPYs (`COPY services/poller/poller/ ./poller/`, `COPY services/poller/poller_routes/ ./poller_routes/`) so new files are picked up automatically.
- **`poller-2` must mirror `poller` configuration.** The `poller-2` service is an optional second poller instance (behind the `poller2` profile) for a different IBKR account. Its `environment:` and `volumes:` blocks must stay in sync with `poller` — same env var names (with `_2` suffix for account-specific values), same `DEDUP_DB_PATH` pointing to the shared `dedup-data` volume, and its own `META_DB_PATH` (e.g. `/data/meta/poller-2.db`) on a dedicated `poller-2-data` volume. When modifying the `poller` service block, always check whether `poller-2` needs the same change.
- **Never nest bind mounts in `docker-compose.test.yml`.** If a service mounts `./services/poller:/app` and you also need `services/notifier/` available, do NOT mount `./services/notifier:/app/notifier` (inside the first mount). Docker will auto-create an empty `services/poller/notifier/` directory on the host to back the nested mount point. On `docker compose restart`, this empty host directory shadows the real content, causing `ImportError`. Instead, mount the extra module at a separate path outside `/app` (e.g. `./services/notifier:/opt/notifier`) and add `PYTHONPATH: /opt` to the service's `environment:` block so Python can find it.

## Architecture

Six Docker containers in a single Compose stack on a DigitalOcean droplet:

| Service              | Role                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ib-gateway`         | IBKR Gateway (gnzsnz/ib-gateway). Restart policy: `on-failure` (not `always`).                                                                        |
| `novnc`              | Browser VNC proxy for 2FA authentication                                                                                                              |
| `caddy`              | Reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS (Let's Encrypt)                                                                                                    |
| `remote-client`      | Python API server — places orders via IB Gateway, optional real-time listener. Disabled (with entire gateway stack) via `REMOTE_CLIENT_ENABLED=false` |
| `poller`             | Polls IBKR Flex for trade confirmations, fires webhooks. Disabled via `POLLER_ENABLED=false`                                                          |
| `gateway-controller` | Lightweight sidecar — starts ib-gateway container via Docker socket                                                                                   |

All secrets are injected via `.env` → `environment` in `docker-compose.yml`.
Caddy reads `VNC_DOMAIN` and `SITE_DOMAIN` from env vars — the Caddyfile uses `{$VNC_DOMAIN}` / `{$SITE_DOMAIN}` syntax.

### Caddy Snippet Structure

The Caddyfile uses `import` directives to compose routing from snippet files:

```
infra/caddy/
  Caddyfile              # Shell: imports from sites/, domains/, and shared dirs
  sites/
    ibkr.caddy           # SITE_DOMAIN route handlers (handle /ibkr/*)
  domains/
    ibkr-vnc.caddy       # VNC_DOMAIN site block (full site definition)
```

Shared projects deploy snippets to `/opt/caddy-shared/{sites,domains}/` on the droplet (not into the host project's directory). The host Caddy mounts both:

- `./infra/caddy/sites/` → `/etc/caddy/sites/` (host project's own routes)
- `/opt/caddy-shared/sites/` → `/etc/caddy/shared-sites/` (shared projects' routes)
- Same pattern for `domains/` and `shared-domains/`.

During shared deploy, snippet files are **templated** — all `{$VAR}` placeholders are replaced with literal env var values from the shared project's `.env`. This avoids requiring the host Caddy container to have the shared project's env vars.

- **`sites/*.caddy`** contain `handle` blocks imported inside the `{$SITE_DOMAIN}` site definition. Each project writes one snippet (e.g. `ibkr.caddy`, `kraken.caddy`). Routes must be prefixed with the project name (`/ibkr/*`, `/kraken/*`) to avoid collisions.
- **`domains/*.caddy`** contain full site definitions (e.g. `{$VNC_DOMAIN} { ... }`), imported at the top level.
- This structure allows multiple projects to share a single Caddy instance on the same droplet.

## Deployment Modes

The deployment mode is controlled by `DEPLOY_MODE` in `.env` (required, validated before any deploy or sync).

### Standalone Mode (`DEPLOY_MODE=standalone`)

- Set `DO_API_TOKEN` in `.env`. `make deploy` runs Terraform to create a new droplet, firewall, and reserved IP, then the CLI rsyncs project files, pushes `.env`, and runs `docker compose up -d --build`.
- Terraform only creates infrastructure — cloud-init installs Docker and creates the project directory. The CLI handles all file transfer and service startup.
- After deploy, add `DROPLET_IP` from terraform output to `.env` for `make sync`.
- `DO_API_TOKEN` can be removed after first deploy for security — the mode is determined by `DEPLOY_MODE`, not by token presence.

### Shared Mode (`DEPLOY_MODE=shared`)

- Set `DROPLET_IP` and `SSH_KEY` in `.env` (no `DO_API_TOKEN` needed).
- `make deploy` rsyncs files, pushes `.env`, and starts services using `docker-compose.shared.yml` overlay.
- The shared overlay disables Caddy (the host project runs it) and connects all containers to `relay-net` external Docker network.
- Caddy snippet files (`infra/caddy/sites/ibkr.caddy`, `infra/caddy/domains/ibkr-vnc.caddy`) must be deployed to the host project's Caddy to enable routing.
- `make sync` uses the shared compose overlay automatically.

## Memory & Droplet Sizing

- `JAVA_HEAP_SIZE` in `.env` controls IB Gateway's JVM heap (in MB, default 768, max 10240).
- **Droplet size is auto-selected** by Terraform based on this value (see `locals` block in `main.tf`).
- **`DROPLET_SIZE`** overrides the heap-based auto-selection with a direct DO slug (e.g. `s-1vcpu-512mb`). Useful for poller-only deployments that don't need IB Gateway memory.
- `cli/__init__.py` `_droplet_size()` checks `DROPLET_SIZE` first, then falls back to `JAVA_HEAP_SIZE`-based calculation.
- `cli/core/resume.py` uses `cfg.droplet_size()` which delegates to the same `_droplet_size()` function.

## Auth Pattern

- API endpoints under `/ibkr/*` require `Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>` (HMAC-safe comparison via `hmac.compare_digest`).
- Webhook payloads are signed with HMAC-SHA256 (`X-Signature-256` header) via the notifier package.
- VNC access is password-protected (VNC protocol auth).

## IB Gateway Lifecycle

- `TWOFA_TIMEOUT_ACTION: exit` — gateway exits cleanly on 2FA timeout (no restart loop).
- `RELOGIN_AFTER_TWOFA_TIMEOUT: "no"` — prevents automatic re-login attempts.
- `restart: on-failure` — Docker restarts only on crashes, not clean exits.
- Sessions last ~1 week before IBKR forces re-authentication.

## E2E Testing

- **E2E tests run against a local Docker stack** with a real IB Gateway connected to a paper trading account. Real orders are placed in paper mode.
- **Credentials live in `.env.test`** (gitignored). Template: `.env.test.example`.
- **`docker-compose.test.yml`** at project root defines the test stack (ib-gateway + remote-client only, no Caddy/poller/VNC).
- **`make e2e`** starts the stack, waits for connection, runs pytest, then tears down. Always cleans up, even on test failure.
- **`make e2e-up` / `make e2e-down`** for manual stack management during debugging.
- **`make e2e-run`** restarts `remote-client` and `poller` containers (to pick up code changes from volume mounts), then runs the E2E tests. Safe to call repeatedly during development — no need to rebuild or restart manually.
- **Test API runs on `localhost:15010`** with hardcoded token `test-token`.
- **No healthcheck on `ib-gateway`** — the `IBClient.connect()` handles retry with exponential backoff, same as production.
- **Paper accounts require no 2FA**, so the E2E stack is fully automated.
- **Session conflict detection** — `make e2e-up` checks `ib-gateway` logs for `"Existing session detected"` during startup. IBKR only allows one session per account — if the production droplet or local-dev stack is connected with the same credentials, the test gateway will be rejected.

## Test File Convention

- **Unit tests are colocated** next to the source file they test: `flex_parser.py` → `test_flex_parser.py`, `orders.py` → `test_orders.py`.
- **E2E tests live in `tests/e2e/`** within each service, since they test multiple components together rather than a single source file.
- **`make test`** runs all unit tests (both services). **`make e2e-run`** runs all E2E tests (requires Docker stack).
- **Always scope `unittest.mock.patch`.** Never call `patch.start()` at module level without a corresponding `patch.stop()` — the patched value leaks into every test module that runs afterward. Use one of these patterns instead:
  - **`setUpModule()` / `tearDownModule()`** — for module-wide patches (e.g. `API_TOKEN` that all tests in the file need).
  - **`self.addCleanup(patcher.stop)`** in `setUp()` — for class-scoped patches.
  - **`with patch(...):`** inside the test — for single-test patches.
  - **`@patch(...)`** decorator — for single-test or single-class patches.
  - Never use bare `_patcher.start()` without registering a `.stop()`.
- **No cross-test dependencies.** Every test must be self-contained — it must not rely on state created by a previous test (e.g. a position opened by an earlier buy test). Pytest does not guarantee execution order, and tests may run selectively or in parallel. If a test needs preconditions, create them within the test itself or via an explicit fixture.
- **E2E conftest fixtures must use `yield` with a context manager.** Never `return httpx.Client(...)` — the client is never closed and leaks sockets. Use `with httpx.Client(...) as client: yield client` instead. Scope to `session` (one client per test run). Every E2E `conftest.py` must also include a `_preflight_check` fixture (`scope="session"`, `autouse=True`) that hits `/health` and calls `pytest.exit()` if the stack is unreachable.

### Routes Package Names

Each service has a uniquely-named routes package to avoid `sys.modules` collisions when both services share `sys.path` (e.g. in pytest, mono-repo):

- `services/remote-client/rc_routes/` — remote-client HTTP handlers (`from rc_routes import create_routes`)
- `services/poller/poller_routes/` — poller HTTP handlers (`from poller_routes import create_routes`)

The same convention is used in `kraken_relay` (`listener_routes/`, `poller_routes/`).

## Remote Client Structure

The `services/remote-client/` service is organized into packages:

```
services/remote-client/
  main.py                  # Entrypoint (connection + HTTP server)
  models_remote_client.py  # Pydantic request/response models (order API)
  client/                  # IB Gateway client (namespace delegation)
    __init__.py            # IBClient class (connection management)
    orders.py              # OrdersNamespace: place(contract_req, order_req)
    test_orders.py         # Tests for orders namespace
    trades.py              # TradesNamespace: list()
    test_trades.py         # Tests for trades namespace
    listener.py            # ListenerNamespace: subscribe to trade events → webhooks
    test_listener.py       # Tests for listener namespace
  rc_routes/               # HTTP route handlers
    __init__.py            # Orchestrator: create_routes()
    middlewares.py         # Auth middleware (Bearer token)
    order_place.py         # POST /ibkr/order
    test_order_place.py    # Tests for order_place route
    trades_list.py         # GET /ibkr/trades
    test_trades_list.py    # Tests for trades_list route
    health.py              # GET /health
  tests/e2e/               # E2E tests (paper account)
    conftest.py            # httpx fixtures (api + anon_api)
    test_smoke.py          # Health + auth smoke tests
    test_trades.py         # Order placement + trade listing
    test_listener.py       # Listener webhook E2E (skips when market closed)
    test_remote_client_enabled.py  # Tests REMOTE_CLIENT_ENABLED toggle
    .env.test.example      # Template for paper credentials
```

- **One file per route** — easy to find and scale.
- **Namespace delegation for IBClient** — `client.orders.place(contract_req, order_req)`. Add new namespaces (e.g. `holdings.py`, `quotes.py`) as needed.
- **Route handlers access the client via `request.app["client"]`**, not closures.

## Poller Structure

The `services/poller/` service follows the same package pattern:

```
services/poller/
  main.py                  # Entrypoint (polling loop + HTTP API startup)
  models_poller.py         # Re-export shim (shared models + poller-specific API types)
  poller/                  # Core polling logic (package)
    __init__.py            # SQLite dedup, Flex fetch, poll_once()
    flex_parser.py         # XML parser (Activity Flex + Trade Confirmation)
    test_flex_parser.py    # Tests for flex_parser
    test_poller.py         # Tests for poller core logic
  poller_routes/            # HTTP API
    __init__.py            # Orchestrator: create_routes(), start_api_server()
    middlewares.py         # Auth middleware (Bearer token)
    run.py                 # POST /ibkr/poller/run handler
  tests/e2e/               # E2E tests
    conftest.py
    test_smoke.py
    test_poller_enabled.py   # Tests POLLER_ENABLED toggle
  Dockerfile
  requirements.txt
```

- **`services/poller/poller/`** contains core logic: SQLite dedup, Flex Web Service two-step fetch, and `poll_once()`. Notification delivery is delegated to the notifier package (see below).
- **`services/poller/poller_routes/`** contains the HTTP API for on-demand polls (`POST /ibkr/poller/run`).
- **`services/poller/models_poller.py`** is a re-export shim for shared models plus poller-specific API types (`RunPollResponse`, `HealthResponse`). The shared models (`Fill`, `Trade`, `WebhookPayloadTrades`, `WebhookPayload`) live in `services/shared/__init__.py`.

## Notifier Structure

The `services/notifier/` package is a **standalone library** (no container, no Dockerfile). It provides a pluggable notification backend system used by the poller.

```
services/notifier/
  __init__.py              # Registry, load_notifiers(), validate_notifier_env(), notify()
  base.py                  # BaseNotifier ABC (name, required_env_vars, send)
  webhook.py               # WebhookNotifier: HMAC-SHA256 signed HTTP POST
  test_notifier.py         # Tests for registry and loader
  test_webhook.py          # Tests for webhook backend
```

- **`NOTIFIERS` env var** controls which backends are active (comma-separated, e.g. `NOTIFIERS=webhook`). Empty = no notifications (dry-run).
- **Suffix support** — `load_notifiers(suffix="_2")` reads from `TARGET_WEBHOOK_URL_2`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET_2`, etc. This powers `poller-2`.
- **`validate_notifier_env()`** is called by `cli/__init__.py` during pre-deploy checks to ensure all required env vars are set for the configured backends.
- **Adding a new backend** — create `services/notifier/<name>.py` with a class extending `BaseNotifier`, add it to `REGISTRY` in `__init__.py`.
- **The poller calls `notify(notifiers, payload)`** — notifiers are loaded once at startup and passed through to `poll_once()`. The poller has no direct knowledge of webhook delivery mechanics.

## Dedup Structure

The `services/dedup/` package is a **standalone library** (no container, no Dockerfile). It provides SQLite dedup logic used by both the poller and the remote-client listener.

```
services/dedup/
  __init__.py              # init_db(), is_processed(), mark_processed(), get_processed_ids(), mark_processed_batch(), prune()
  test_dedup.py            # Tests for dedup module
```

- **`init_db(db_path)`** creates the `processed_fills` table and returns a `sqlite3.Connection`.
- **`is_processed(conn, exec_id)`** — single-ID check (used by listener).
- **`get_processed_ids(conn, exec_ids)`** — batch check (used by poller).
- **`mark_processed(conn, exec_id)`** — single-ID mark (used by listener).
- **`mark_processed_batch(conn, exec_ids)`** — batch mark (used by poller).
- **`prune(conn, days=30)`** — delete old entries.
- **Shared dedup DB** — both services read/write the same `fills.db` at `DEDUP_DB_PATH` (default `/data/dedup/fills.db`) on a `dedup-data` Docker named volume. SQLite WAL mode + `timeout=5.0` enables safe concurrent access.
- **Dedup key priority** — `ibExecId → transactionId → tradeID`, resolved in `services/poller/poller/flex_parser.py` at parse time by setting `Fill.execId`. `services/shared/__init__.py::_dedup_id()` simply returns the already-resolved `fill.execId`. `ibExecId` is preferred because it is the common identifier between Flex XML fills and ib_async execution events.
- The poller has a separate metadata DB at `META_DB_PATH` (default `/data/meta.db`) on a `poller-data` volume for the timestamp watermark. The poller's `init_dedup_db()` wraps `dedup.init_db()`; `init_meta_db()` manages the metadata table independently.

## Listener (Real-Time Trade Events)

The listener is an **opt-in** feature (`LISTENER_ENABLED` env var) that subscribes to ib_async trade events and fires webhooks immediately when orders fill.

- **Lives in `client/listener.py`** inside the remote-client service — it is a `ListenerNamespace`, same pattern as `OrdersNamespace`.
- **Subscribes to two events**: `execDetailsEvent` (fill without commission) and `commissionReportEvent` (fill with commission). `execDetailsEvent` always fires immediately (no dedup, no debounce). `commissionReportEvent` is deduplicated by `execId` via the shared `services/dedup/` module — duplicates after reconnect are skipped.
- **Event subscriptions survive reconnects** — ib_async creates events in `__init__`, not in `connectAsync()`.
- **Maps ib_async objects to `Fill`** via `_map_to_fill()`. A helper `_fill_to_trade()` wraps a single `Fill` in a 1-fill `Trade` for immediate dispatch. When debouncing, fills are aggregated into multi-fill `Trade` objects via `aggregate_fills()`.
- **The `source` field** on `Trade` distinguishes origin: `"flex"`, `"execDetailsEvent"`, or `"commissionReportEvent"`.
- **Shared dedup DB** — the listener uses the same `dedup-data` volume and `DEDUP_DB_PATH` as the poller. Both services read/write `fills.db` concurrently (SQLite WAL + `timeout=5.0`). This means a fill processed by the listener is automatically skipped by the next poll cycle, and vice versa.
- **Debounce** — controlled by `LISTENER_EVENT_DEBOUNCE_TIME` env var (milliseconds, default `0` = disabled). When enabled, `commissionReportEvent` fills are buffered per `orderId` in `_pending`. Each new fill resets the debounce timer (`asyncio.get_event_loop().call_later`). When the timer fires, `_flush()` does batch dedup → `aggregate_fills()` → `mark_processed_batch()` → dispatch. This aggregates rapid partial fills into a single webhook per order.
- **Prune** — the listener prunes the dedup DB at startup and every 24 hours via `_schedule_prune()` → `_run_scheduled_prune()` → reschedule cycle using `call_later`. 30-day retention.
- **Async dispatch** — `asyncio.ensure_future(asyncio.to_thread(notify, ...))` fire-and-forget. The `notify()` function uses synchronous `httpx.post`, so it runs in a thread to avoid blocking the ib_async event loop.
- **Side mapping**: `"BOT"` → `BuySell.BUY`, `"SLD"` → `BuySell.SELL`.
- **UNSET sentinel**: ib_async uses `1.7976931348623157e308` for unset floats — the listener treats this as `0.0`.

## Models (Three Locations)

This project has **three model locations** — a shared source of truth and two service-specific files:

| File                                             | Domain                | Contains                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `services/shared/__init__.py`                    | CommonFill (outbound) | `Fill`, `Trade`, `WebhookPayloadTrades`, `WebhookPayload`, `BuySell`, `OrderType`, `Source`, `aggregate_fills()`, `_dedup_id()` |
| `services/poller/models_poller.py`               | Poller API (outbound) | Re-exports shared models + `RunPollResponse`, `HealthResponse`                                          |
| `services/remote-client/models_remote_client.py` | Order API (inbound)   | `ContractPayload`, `OrderPayload`, `PlaceOrderPayload`, `PlaceOrderResponse` — REST API types           |

- **`services/shared/__init__.py`** is the single source of truth for all webhook payload models. Both poller and remote-client import from it.
- **Unique filenames** (`models_poller.py`, `models_remote_client.py`) prevent import collisions when both `services/poller/` and `services/remote-client/` are on `sys.path` (via the `.pth` file). Use `from shared import Fill` for shared types, `from models_poller import RunPollResponse` for poller-specific types.
- **Model shims only re-export models and types** (Pydantic models, enums, type aliases). Utility functions (`aggregate_fills`, `normalize_order_type`, `_dedup_id`) must be imported directly from the owning module: `from shared import aggregate_fills`. Never re-export functions through model shims.
- `models_poller.py` re-exports shared models and defines poller-specific API types. Its `SCHEMA_MODELS` contains only `[RunPollResponse, HealthResponse]`.
- `shared/__init__.py` defines `SCHEMA_MODELS = [WebhookPayloadTrades, Trade, Fill]` for the shared types.
- `models_remote_client.py` is the source of truth for `IbkrHttp` TypeScript types (`make types`).
- `models_remote_client.py` uses strict `Literal` types (`Action`, `OrderType`, `SecType`, `TimeInForce`) aligned with `ib_async` field names.
- All external-contract models use `ConfigDict(extra="forbid")` for strict validation.

## Naming Convention for API Models

All public-facing Pydantic models follow the pattern **`{Action}{Resource}{InterfaceType}`**:

| Suffix     | Meaning                              | Example              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `Payload`  | Request body (POST/PUT JSON payload) | `PlaceOrderPayload`  |
| `Response` | Response body returned to the caller | `PlaceOrderResponse` |
| `Params`   | Query parameters (GET requests)      | `ListTradesParams`   |

Rules:

- **Payload** = what the client sends in the body. Nested sub-models also use `Payload` (e.g. `ContractPayload`, `OrderPayload`).
- **Response** = what the server returns. Prefixed with the action to avoid ambiguity (`PlaceOrderResponse`, not `OrderResponse`).
- **Params** = URL query parameters, used for GET endpoints.
- Domain types (`Action`, `OrderType`, `SecType`, `TimeInForce`, `BuySell`) have no suffix — they are not API interface types.
- **Group by endpoint, not by type.** All interfaces for a single endpoint (Payload, Response, Params) must live together in the same section of their `models_*.py` file. Do not separate Payloads and Responses into different blocks — group them by the action they belong to (e.g. all `PlaceOrder*` models together, all `ListTrades*` models together).

## Order API Payload

The `POST /ibkr/order` endpoint accepts a nested payload mirroring `ib.placeOrder(contract, order)`:

```json
{
  "contract": {
    "symbol": "TSLA",
    "secType": "STK",
    "exchange": "SMART",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "order": {
    "action": "BUY",
    "totalQuantity": 2,
    "orderType": "LMT",
    "lmtPrice": 150.0
  }
}
```

- Field names match `ib_async` exactly (e.g. `lmtPrice`, `totalQuantity`, `secType`, `tif`, `outsideRth`).
- `contract.secType` defaults to `"STK"`, `contract.exchange` to `"SMART"`, `contract.currency` to `"USD"`.
- `order.tif` defaults to `"DAY"`, `order.outsideRth` to `false`.
- Pydantic validates the full request; invalid payloads return 400 with structured error details.

## TypeScript Types

### Namespace Convention (cross-relay standard)

All relay projects export TypeScript types using a two-tier namespace pattern:

- **`types/shared/`** → exported as the **relay's primary namespace** (named after the exchange: `Ibkr`, `Kraken`, etc.). Contains the CommonFill models (`Fill`, `Trade`, `WebhookPayloadTrades`, `WebhookPayload`, `BuySell`) generated from `services/shared/__init__.py` SCHEMA_MODELS. Every relay has this.
- **`types/<module>/`** → exported as **`<RelayName><ModuleName>`** (e.g. `IbkrPoller`, `IbkrHttp`). Contains service-specific types generated from that module's `SCHEMA_MODELS`. Only created when a service has unique types not in shared.

The barrel `types/index.d.ts` ties them together:

```ts
import * as Ibkr from "./shared";
import * as IbkrPoller from "./poller";
import * as IbkrHttp from "./http";
export { Ibkr, IbkrPoller, IbkrHttp };
```

A relay with no service-specific types (e.g. kraken_relay) has only the shared namespace:

```ts
export * as Kraken from "./shared";
```

### IBKR Relay Types

- Types are published as `@tradegist/ibkr-relay-types` (npm package in `types/`, not yet published).
- **Three namespaces**: `Ibkr` (shared webhook payload types), `IbkrPoller` (poller-specific API types), and `IbkrHttp` (order API types).
- **`make types`** regenerates all three from Pydantic models:
  - `services/shared/__init__.py` → `types/shared/types.d.ts` (CommonFill models: WebhookPayloadTrades, Trade, Fill, BuySell)
  - `services/poller/models_poller.py` → `types/poller/types.d.ts` (poller-specific: RunPollResponse, HealthResponse)
  - `services/remote-client/models_remote_client.py` → `types/http/types.d.ts` (order API types)
- **Structure:**
  ```
  types/
    index.d.ts                 # Barrel: exports Ibkr, IbkrPoller, IbkrHttp namespaces
    package.json               # @tradegist/ibkr-relay-types
    shared/
      index.d.ts               # Re-exports: BuySell, Fill, Trade, WebhookPayloadTrades, WebhookPayload
      types.d.ts               # Generated from shared/__init__.py (SCHEMA_MODELS)
      types.schema.json         # Intermediate JSON Schema
    poller/
      index.d.ts               # Re-exports: RunPollResponse, HealthResponse
      types.d.ts               # Generated from poller/models_poller.py (SCHEMA_MODELS)
      types.schema.json         # Intermediate JSON Schema
    http/
      index.d.ts               # Re-exports: PlaceOrderPayload, ContractPayload, OrderPayload, PlaceOrderResponse
      types.d.ts               # Generated from remote-client/models_remote_client.py (SCHEMA_MODELS)
      types.schema.json         # Intermediate JSON Schema
  ```
- **Usage:** `import { Ibkr, IbkrPoller, IbkrHttp } from "@tradegist/ibkr-relay-types"`
- Each model file declares a `SCHEMA_MODELS` list at the bottom — `schema_gen.py` reads it to generate the JSON Schema. **To export a new model to TypeScript, append it to `SCHEMA_MODELS` in the relevant `models_*.py` or `shared/__init__.py` file and update the corresponding `types/*/index.d.ts` re-exports.**

## Code Style

- Python: `logging` module, f-strings, `aiohttp` for async HTTP in both remote-client and poller, `httpx` for sync HTTP client in poller.
- CLI scripts: Python (`cli/` package), invoked via `python3 -m cli <command>` or `make`. Uses only stdlib (`subprocess`, `urllib.request`, `json`, `os`). No third-party dependencies. Uses lazy dispatch (`importlib.import_module`) — each command only imports its own module.
- Terraform: all secrets marked `sensitive = true` in `variables.tf`.

## Build & Deploy

All commands available via `make` or `python3 -m cli <command>`:

```bash
make deploy    # Standalone: Terraform | Shared: rsync + compose (reads .env)
make sync      # Push .env to droplet + restart services
make sync LOCAL_FILES=1  # rsync files + rebuild + restart (full code deploy)
make destroy   # Terraform destroy
make pause     # Snapshot + delete droplet (save costs)
make resume    # Restore from snapshot
make poll      # Trigger immediate Flex poll
make order     # Place an order
make e2e       # Run E2E tests (paper account)
make lint      # Run ruff linter (FIX=1 to auto-fix)
```

Direct CLI (no Make required, works on Windows):

```bash
python3 -m cli deploy
python3 -m cli sync gateway
python3 -m cli sync --local-files
python3 -m cli order 2 TSLA MKT
python3 -m cli poll 2
```

## Deployment Model (MANDATORY)

- **`make sync LOCAL_FILES=1` uses rsync** to transfer files from the local working tree to `/opt/ibkr-relay/` on the droplet. It does NOT use git on the droplet — no git clone, no deploy keys, no GitHub access needed from the server.
- **Guards:** Must be on `main` branch with a clean working tree (no uncommitted changes). This ensures rsync deploys a known committed state.
- **`--delete` flag:** rsync removes files on the droplet that no longer exist locally. This correctly handles renames and deletions but is dangerous for server-generated files.
- **Invariant: the project directory (`/opt/ibkr-relay/`) contains only source files.** No service, script, or container may write files into the project directory. All runtime-generated data (databases, caches, logs, certificates) MUST use Docker named volumes (e.g. `poller-data:/data`, `caddy-data:/data`). Docker volumes live under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`, completely outside the project directory, and are safe from rsync `--delete`.
- **When adding new runtime data** (a new database, cache file, upload directory, etc.): create a Docker named volume in `docker-compose.yml` and mount it into the container. Never write to a path inside `/opt/ibkr-relay/`.
- **`.deployed-sha`** is the only server-side file inside the project directory. It is written by `cli/sync.py` after each `--local-files` sync and is excluded from rsync `--delete`. It records the deployed commit SHA for traceability.
- **rsync exclusions** (files never overwritten or deleted on the droplet):
  - `.git/` — not present on droplet (no git repo)
  - `.env` — pushed separately via scp (contains secrets)
  - `.env.test` — local-only test config
  - `.deployed-sha` — server-side deployment marker
  - Everything in `.gitignore` — via `--filter ':- .gitignore'`
